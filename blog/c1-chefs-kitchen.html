      I’m really excited be a part of the DBC environment. I mentioned in my interview and also the introductory session this week that the reason I chose DBC over other bootcamps was seeing the video on Engineering Empathy. I knew right away that a program that linked potential applicants to a video of a guy with tribal tattoos explaining the importance of mindfulness, behavior, and neuroplasticity was the kind of program I wanted to be a part of.

       Meditation, mindfulness, and self-examination have all been at the forefront of my path to deeper understanding over the past few years, and I’m really excited to be a part of a program and culture like DBC where these values are taught and strengthened.

        Shereef’s perspective of a kitchen vs. restaurant mindset was interesting to me as well. Hearing him explain it in those terms has allowed me to identify this difference in mindset and the problems that might be caused by holding onto a consumerist restaurant point of view. If I find myself slipping into that perspective, I’ll try to identify it so I can put my apron and rubber gloves back on and get back to work churning the butter.
