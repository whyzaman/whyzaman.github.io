      When I took the Gregorc Thinking Style quiz, I was pleased by how accurately the result seemed to be. I was categorized as an Abstract Random Thinker but there was only 1 point separating me from being a Concrete Random Thinker, so I think it can be concluded that aspects of both categories are present in my learning style. First, let's take a look at what the quiz itself says about these two styles of learning.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      An Abstract Random thinker likes "to listen to others" and "bringing harmony to group situations." They learn best when "able to participate in group activities" and struggle when "working with dictatorial/authoritarian personalities" or "working in a restrictive environment."
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A Concrete Random thinker likes "experimenting to find answers" and to "use their intuition" and "take risks." They learn best from "trial-and-error approaches" and have trouble with routines, formal reports, and "re-doing anything once itâ€™s done."
    </p>

    <p>
      From my own experiences, these seem to be spot-on categorizations. In school I always excelled in class discussions and I think I retained information best by being able to participate in the lecture, asking questions, and just being very involved in general. The segment about struggling with authoritarian personalities definitely rings true when thinking about certain teachers whose classes always seemed to be a struggle to get through. They usually didn't appreciate my involvement in class discussions and found it more distracting for others than helpful. My 8th grade history teacher Ms. Parker even told me that the very sound of my voice irritated her and she would tell me to shut up if I ever spoke up. I don't think I did well in her class. Ah, middle school.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of class, I do like experimental methods to learn. I think that's why I always did well in my math classes, because there was something so enjoyable about solving equations for hours on end until a concept suddenly clicked in my head. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In terms of how to use this knowledge of my learning style to influence my strategies at DBC, I don't think I need to be particularly concerned about a restrictive environment or dictatorial personalities, which is one of the factors that drew me towards DBC in the first place. It seems like a place that values the myriad ways of learning and embraces the differences between people rather than trying to restrict people to a single learning style. Of course, if I do encounter such personalities, I would use DBC's tenets of integrity, kindness, and actionable feedback.
