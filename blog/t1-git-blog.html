      Git is a type of version control software that allows users to track the changes they’ve made on a project. As an analogy, let’s say I’ve drawn a rough pencil sketch of Superman, but I’m not sure how I want the finished piece to look. Is Supes fighting a Lex Luthor or is he hanging out with Lois Lane? Is he in Metropolis or outer space? I don’t want to continue drawing over my only copy of the sketch, so I make copies. If I ever need to go back, I have that option available to me. This is version control. Now I can start filling in details, like the Metropolis skyline in the background. I can continually copy my progress so that I have something to go back to in case I mess up or something doesn’t feel right. If I want to branch out in a different direction, I can go back to my initial copy.
    </p>

      This is the capability that git offers to developers. An important point to note is that git’s version control occurs locally on one’s computer. GitHub allows users to upload a project remotely, and collaborate by accessing the master file, making changes on their own, and when ready, pushing those changes back to the master file.
    </p>

      This seems like a great way for developers to collaborate. Developer A can work on his part of the code without having to worry about overwriting Developer B’s portion, and if anything suddenly goes wrong, there’s a history of all the changes that have been made, so the error can be easily determined.
