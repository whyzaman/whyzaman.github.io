      The elegant simplicity of HTML is that everything is a box. Every element, every paragraph, every div and span is interpretted and rendered as a simple box. The benefit of this fact is that when laying out a webpage, thinking of each element in terms of its inherent boxiness makes things infinitely easier.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We can conceive of a webpage as a collection of boxes arranged together in interesting ways. In order to position our boxes to our liking, we must understand how to space them in reference to each other. Each element has padding, borders, and margins whose values can be customized.

    <p>As this diagram shows, our element's content is the central box. On top of the content is its padding, which can be changed to increase or decrease the space between the element and an adjacent element.</p>

    <p>Above the padding is the border, which is typically solid and 1 or 2 pixels, but can be even greater depending on ones needs.</p>

    <p>The space around the border is the margin, which separates the element from other elements</p>

    <p>By understanding these concepts, spacing elements on a webpage becomes a breeze!</p>
